- Usage

  - Building entire webapps with technology I've never used before.

  - Teaching me how to use various frameworks having never previously used them.

  - Converting dozens of programs to C or Rust to improve performance 10-100x.

  - Trimming down large codebases to significantly simplify the project.

  - Writing the initial experiment code for nearly every research paper I've written in the last year.

  - Automating nearly every monotonous task or one-off script.

  - Almost entirely replaced web searches for helping me set up and configure new packages or projects.

  - About 50% replaced web searches for helping me debug error messages

- “Helping me learn” and “Automating boring tasks”
