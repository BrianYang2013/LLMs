**09-02-2024:** OCR task, identify chinese characters in 2 images. Around 09:00 EST time zone. 

- OpenAI: 99% correct, successfully finish the task (need minor adjustment, maybe due to sensitive words)
- Google: Gives the first 5 lines and starts to summarize. Not following the simple instruction... maybe due to system prompt to restrict the output words? 
- Claude: Failed a few times due to resources constrain, and sugges to upgrade to pro. Later on give the first few lines
